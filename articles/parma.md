## Parma Rant 🐔🐷🍅🧀🍟🍃

8<sup>th</sup> August 2017

Just like many pub goers, I enjoy a quality 'parma' as we like to call them down here in Australia. Of course I'm referring to the ever present pub meal the ✨Chicken Parmigiana✨. Maybe 1 out of every 6 or 7 times I go to a pub I'll end up ordering this delicious, classic meal. I'm definitely not alone. There are even meetups around Melbourne dedicated to tasting parmas across the city. That's a strong, passionate following if I've ever seen one. It must be said that not all parmas are created equal, and that's okay. It's good to mix it up. Some are insanely big and make you wonder what type of chicken they are growing out on the farms. Others will use bacon instead of ham, some even add pineapple into the mix (queue the wrath of the pineapple pizza haters). I once tried an "American" style parma that came with Mac 'n' Cheese and chorizo on top. The point is, parmas are crazy, parmas are wonder, and people care about parmas.  

Your basic parma will consist of a boneless chicken breast that has been crumbed, topped with ham, tomato sauce/paste and finally some cheese. Most pubs will add some chips or fries and if they are feeling extra generous you might even get a salad on the side. The chips and salad previously would come in small bowls on the side of your meal. That might be possibly why people will ask for "a side of chips" with their meal. 😮 A while ago there was a shift. A shitty shift. The shittiest shift that has ever shifted. Someone started a trend. A stupid trend to put the chips underneath the parma. Somehow it caught on like wildfire. No one asked for this. It only makes eating your parma harder to eat as there isn't a stable base to cut into your delicious poultry delight. Whilst extremely annoying, I slowly came to accept it and have managed to make my peace with it. But last night, at a quiet pub in Coburg, a crime was committed against my parma. Not only did they adhere to the stupid trend of placing the chips under the parma, but they then had the audacity to place a full salad directly on TOP. 😱😡😠😩😤 I order parmas for 3 reasons: You get a lot, it's pretty damn tasty, and you can eat it straight away (doesn't have to cool down or anything). They made my last point a lie. A whole minute was wasted, gone, out the window, never getting it back, scraping off the salad to the side (WHERE IT BELONGS) so that I could satisfy my stomach with the chicken it so longingly awaits.  

Parmas are a gift from the Gods, bestowed upon the undeserving mankind. This gift has been violated. We, as mankind, have failed each other.

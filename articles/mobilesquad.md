## The Legend of the Mobile Squad ðŸ“±

25<sup>th</sup> July 2017

I have recently been a part of a 3 developer squad that created and release a Xamarin App. It was the company's first Xamarin App and was a follow on project from my time in the [R&D Room.](/?article=3) The app we created is called **StarRez X** and will be available in the App Store and Google Play Store.

This post is not about how we created the app. Instead it is about the book that I created about creating the app. That's right, I made a book. It all started when I agreed to do an internal "tech talk" about my time on the mobile squad. I'm not usually one for normal presentations so I was thinking of a better way to present the _story_ of the team. If I was going to tell a story, I might as well give that story a book. I also remembered going to a meetup years ago (I was awfully sick and we went to see Florence and the Machine at the Sydney Myer Music Bowl that night) where one of the presenters hand painted a little image for each slide. I really liked the idea, and it has apparently kept with me. I decided I would use water colour paint though I had never really used it before. I don't really fancy myself a painter but there is an arty side in me somewhere so off I went to buy some supplies. 

Before I could start painting I needed to write a basic script to work out what I what slides I would need. I decided to split my presentation up into chapters and filled out the script with slides then decided on what images to paint. I knew I would need to paint people so I wanted to come up with my own "artistic style" of drawing people. I didn't want it to be too life like because that would be too much work and would probably just look shit in the end, but I also didn't want it to be too simplistic otherwise it would be hard to identify the people I was attempting to draw. I remember myself and my partner sitting in the back of my car with a pen and paper each sketching up different styles. We were parked just outside our favourite home decor shop Matt Blatt waiting to meet up with our friends for dinner. We were early. So we sat and we sketched. There were many interesting ideas that come out of that session but it lead my to decide on the following:
- Big circular head
- Oversized circular eyes
- Long skinny legs
- "Spaghetti arms" (not always elbows)

It took me quite a while to finish all the drawings. I found some pages really difficult to come up with an image to describe it. Especially pages that were quite technical. The last image I drew was to represent "data binding" and it ended up being two rectangles with a double arrow pointing between. They say a picture can speak a thousand words, but I guess it's hard to put a 2 technical words into a silly illustration. Awful analogies aside, it was difficult but also quite fun. I didn't really know what I was doing with water colours at the start. I had a brush that you unscrewed and filled with water so that it kept itself wet which was quite neat. Slowly I started figuring out how much water I needed and how much paint to use and that you could even combine paints to make any mix of colours you could imagine.

[Momento](https://www.momento.com.au) was the company I decided to go with to print the book I was creating. My father had used them many times to turn our family travels into wonderful albums. You download their free software and start building it up like you would a PowerPoint presentation. Most pages consist of some text on the left page and an image on the right. I had to Photoshop each image so that they were all roughly the same size and I added a subtle drop shadow to each image so that it popped off the page a little. The booked ended up coming to 97 pages long which was much more than I thought it would. Once the book was finished and reviewed at least 10 times I uploaded it to their website and ordered 2 copies (one for me and one for work). I'm not going to lie, the books aren't cheap. If I ever do this again I will probably look around and see if there is a cheaper competitor but at least I know the quality of the print will be amazing.

That's pretty much it. As of writing this I haven't received my books nor have I given my presentation. If you would like to [see a preview of the book you can click here.](views/momento.html) Below I have a few of my favourite drawings from the project. I'm not going to provide any context for the images because it's funnier trying to imagine how the hell some of these are relevant!

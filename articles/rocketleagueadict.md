Soccer... with cars... that can fly... Sounds stupid right? It is. But, it is also insanely adicitve and brought out a side on me that I haven't seen in many, many years.  

### The Good Ol' Days

My family was always a Playstation family. My parents never bought an XBox or Nintendo console throughout my childhood. We had the Playstation 1, PS2, and the PS3 when it finally came out. I adored my Playstation 1, spending countless hours in games like Crash Bandicoot 1/2/3, Spyro, Croc, and Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. I had _my_ 1MB memory card and my brother had his. I remember the stream of tears that errupted when he wiped my memory card after some petty fight. I felt like my lifes work had been cleared from the pages of history.  

The PS2 days were shorter lived, and the PS3 days even more so. With each console I found less and less time to spend delved into games. There were some exceptions though, Guitar Hero was my obsession for the better part of 6 months. I even had a video on YouTube of me playing the intro to Sweet Child of Mine by Guns 'n' Roses on expert mode with my back turned to the screen and my eyes closed. The last game I've felt really committed to was Lego Batman 2. My girlfriend and I played the 2 player story and completed the game to 100%. That was back in 2013. Since then, I've barely touched gaming myself. Instead, I found various YouTube channels where I watched people play games. [Nerd<sup>3</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKab3hYnOoTZZbEUQBMx-ww): general gaming, [Northern Lion](https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion): Binding of Isaac, and [Etho](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKDEp9si4RmHFWJW1vYsMA): Minecraft. Oh yeh, Minecraft, the game that kept popping up. Over the years there were servers with friends, servers at work and even servers I set up for my little cousins to play on. But even the great Minecraft died off too. And then came Rocket League.  

### The Attraction

I first saw Nerd<sup>3</sup> and Northern Lion review/play the game on YouTube. It was fast paced, energetic and really well put together. I instantly liked the game and hoped every day there would be a new video for me to watch. This went on until one day I visted my friend and managed to bring it up in conversation. His grin told me that he already knew about Rocket League, and better yet, he had already downloaded it and was playing it. This was my first physical contact with Rocket League (by proxy of keyboard and mouse) and can generally be accepted and pointed to as the origin of my adiction. If only I had known then how much this game would take over my life.  

We started off by playing against the bots (who are actually pretty decent, I'd love to know the code design behind these guys) but got bored after winning match after match. Time to join the online multiplayer. There are two modes in online, Ranked and Unranked. **Grand Champion** is the highest rank that can be achieved in Ranked mode. Your rank goes up and down for winning/losing matches and there are separate ranks for Singles, Doubles and Standard (Triples). Unranked is simply online matches with no rank involved. It was a while before I dared join the Ranked pool.  

### The Money

Unfortunately I couldn't stay at my friend's house forever. I arrived home still high on Rocket League's energy, wanting to play more. There was a problem though. A big problem. I didn't have a gaming PC or a PS4 required to play. ðŸ’¡! My younger brother had a gaming PC. We agreed, if I payed for the game, he would download it and let me play. Oh boy, was that a mistake, he became even more obsessed than I. We started to take turns playing, first one match each, then 3 at a time. After a while I created my own account and bought the game again for myself so that I could level up my own account. In hindsight I'm suprised it lasted as long as it did before he cracked at me for "always being on his computer".  

Ladies and gentlement. I'm not proud of what I did, but I certainly don't regret it. I dropped over $1000 AUD on a gaming machine so that I could continue this drug-level addiction in the comfort of my own room. That's right, I built a gaming rig, just to play a stupid car game. If you think that the money spending stops there, I'm sorry to tell you this, but it sadly does not. With a new update to the game came crates. The genius system to keep players paying for aesthetic and cosmetic items for their cars. If you have played Rocket League, you know the sufferring of getting a shitty decal, and the absolute euphoria of getting those sweet set of wheels you've been yearning for.

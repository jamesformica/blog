Soccer... with cars... that can fly... Sounds stupid right? It is. But it is also insanely addictive and brought out a side of me that I haven't seen in many, many years.  

### The Good Ol' Days

My family was always a PlayStation family, we had the PlayStation, PS2, and the PS3 when it finally came out. I adored my Playstation 1, spending countless hours in games like Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Croc, and Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. I had _my_ 1MB memory card and my brother had his. I remember the stream of tears that erupted when he wiped my memory card after a petty fight. It felt like my life's work had been cleared from the pages of history.  

The PS2 days were shorter lived, and the PS3 days even more so. With each console I found less and less time to spend delved into games. Or rather, I found other things to spend my time on. There were some brief moments where I lapsed and jumped back into the gaming world. Guitar Hero was my obsession for the better part of 6 months and Lego Batman 2 was probably the last game I've really committed to and that was back in 2013. Since then I've barely touched gaming. I changed from playing games to watching people play games on YouTube, there was less effort involved and I still got my fix. Shout out to: [Nerd<sup>3</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKab3hYnOoTZZbEUQBMx-ww): general gaming, [Northern Lion](https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion): Binding of Isaac, and [Etho](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKDEp9si4RmHFWJW1vYsMA): Minecraft. Oh Minecraft, the game that tried to pull me back in. Over the years there were servers with friends, servers at work and even servers I set up for my cousins to play on. But even the great Minecraft died off too. And then came Rocket League...  

### The Attraction

I first watched Nerd<sup>3</sup> and Northern Lion play the game on YouTube. It was fast paced, energetic and really well put together by a company called Psyonix. I instantly fell in love and hoped every day there would be a new video for me to watch. This went on until one day I visited my friend and managed to bring it up in conversation. His grin told me that he already knew about Rocket League, and better yet, he was already playing it. This was my first physical contact with Rocket League and can generally be accepted as the origin of my addiction. If only I had known then how much this game would take over my life.  

We started off by playing against the bots, switching turns to play on the keyboard and mouse. Winning match after match got a bit boring so we switched over to online multiplayer. The thrill of playing with randoms across the country, working as a team to win, being congratulated when you scored a goal. It was a soul lifting experience and is honestly Rocket League's greatest achievement. Many beers were emptied as we laughed at each others mistakes and cheered at each others heroics.

### The Money

Unfortunately I couldn't stay at my friend's house forever. I arrived home still high on Rocket League's energy, wanting to play more. There was a problem though. A big problem. I didn't have a gaming PC or a PS4. 💡! My younger brother had a gaming PC so I made a deal with him. if I payed for the game he would download it and let me play. Oh boy, was that a mistake, he became even more obsessed than I. We started to take turns playing, first one match each, then three at a time. About a week later I created my own account and bought the game again for myself so that I could level up my own account. In hindsight I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did before he cracked it at me for "always being on his computer".  

Ladies and gentlemen. I'm not proud of what I did, but I certainly don't regret it. I dropped over $1100 AUD on a gaming machine so that I could continue this drug-level addiction in the comfort of my own room. That's right, I built a gaming rig just to play a stupid car game. And if you think that the money spending stops there, I'm sorry to tell you this but you are sadly mistaken. With a new update came crates. The genius system designed to keep players throwing money at Psyonix like a dancer on stage. The crates would (wheel of fortune style) unlock an aesthetic/cosmetic item for your cars. If you have opened a crate, you know the utter despair of getting the same shitty decal, and the absolute euphoria of getting that sweet set of wheels you've been yearning for.  

The following is a shameless breakdown of the money I have ~~wasted~~ put into this wonderful game:

### The Dark Side

The early days playing were really what kept me hooked on the game. I would play with my brother, my friend, and even an old highschool friend that I hadn't spoke to in years. We were all shit, but we would entertain ourselves for hours over voice chat. As we got better my friend and I made the jump from keyboard to controller to help improve our skills. We then discovered something that changed our mentality for the worse: End of season rewards. At the end of each season (currently in the never ending abyss of Season 3) there are rewards given to you based on how high you got your rank. The first season was car toppers, the second season was boost trails and it has recently been revealed that season three will grace us peasants with the beauty of some dope ass wheels.

Now that we had something to gain (other than bragging rights) for ranking up we began getting serious. I felt my competitive side come out more than it had ever with a game before. The climb up the ranks seemed impossible when winning 3 matches would get you nowhere but losing 1 sent you down a division. My desk became my punching bag and my poor Lego rocket ship set has been smashed by my tossed controller so many times I tear up just thinking about it 😢.  

I love this game, but boy does it get my blood pumping for the wrong reasons. I used to prefer playing unranked because there was no pressure, it was simply me and my mates having a laugh.

Me: Play unranked and enjoy the company of your friends

Me to me: Play competitive, rage quit and sabotage your friendships

### When you know it's gone too far

If you hadn't clued on yet I would consider myself somewhat competitive in nature and apparently I'm not the only one. Rocket League was quick to become an eSport with professional teams competing for prize money. Psyonix and Twitch soon organised the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) where these teams would compete at the highest level for the highest prize pool in the game's history. I remember getting to work early on the final day of the first RLCS and streaming the finals from my desk. I managed to catch the grand final match between iBP Cosmic and FlipSid3 Tactics. I remember texting my brother when iBP managed to pull a win and getting the prompt response "fuck you! you spoiled the surprise!"  

Things got turned up a notch for the second RLCS where I planned to watch more than just the grand final. Here in Eastern Australia the stream started at midnight and went to 7:00am. The second day started at midnight Sunday and went into the wee hours of Monday morning leaving little time to sleep for work. Solution: take the day off work. I spent a day of my annual leave so that I could watch a Twitch stream of some 16 year old kids playing competitive car soccer. Thankfully my friend had the day off as well so at 3am Monday morning I drove to his house and we watched the tournament. He didn't actually have internet connected to the house yet so he purchased a bunch of data for his phone and we streamed it from his PS4 tethered to his phone #dedicated. Beers and Rocket League, just like old times.

### Summary

I have a love/hate relationship with this game and I think that's why I keep coming back. Thank you Psyonix for this magnificent roller coaster of a game that's provided me some extremely high highs and some guilty lows. Rocket League goes to show that a good game doesn't need to have mind blowing graphics it just needs to be executed well and have a great community behind it.

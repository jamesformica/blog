## How this blog got it's name

31<sup>st</sup> January 2017

My very first blog post on my brand spankin' new blog site. How exciting! And, to kick things off, I've quite fittingly decided to talk about the name of this blog. After all, it is a bit of an **_odd_** name.

Monring discussions at work. We all have them. You know, the random chats you have with coworkers before the _real_ work begins. Well an interesting discussion got going on a Monday morning about a week ago. Initially I wasn't even involved in the conversation but was happily listening along. The topic: What's at the edge of the universe. I know what you're thinking, a bit heavy for a Monday morning right? I thought it was, but nevertheless I was happy to hear the conversation play out. The typical back and forth ensued with opinions and hypothesis being thrown around. The shape of the universe was even called into question where it was somehow mutually decided that the universe was a donut shape... Apparently this is now fact!

Up until this point it had remained quite a serious conversation, but that quickly changed as the following conversation played out between my colleage and me:

```
(them) What is at the edge of the universe?  

(me) Clearly the spicest of memes!   
 
(them) YES! And all your missing odd socks!
 
(me) Yep, that settles it. At the edge of the universe is spicy memes and odd socks. We've solved it lads.
```

So that's it. Quite underwhelming I'm sure, but we did have a good laugh about it and it just kinda stuck with me. I always do enjoy morning discussions. The always prove to be the weirdest, in-depth and wholesome chats at work. 

> I encourage more morning discussions and look forward to future derailments of serious chatter.

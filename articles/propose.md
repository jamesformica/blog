## Being pressured into proposing

6<sup>th</sup> February 2017

This November will mark the 8<sup>th</sup> anniversary between me and my partner. That's a lot of years and apparently too many years to remain unwed. This post's intention is in no way to condemn marriage but to highlight some changes in perhaps my generation's mindset on the topic.  

It is also worth mentioning that my feelings and opinions expressed on this page have been communicated with my partner. I would want to know her thoughts and feelings, and I do, and she knows mine.

### Traditional Italian Weddings

I'm Italian. My dad's side is a typically big Italian family with many aunts and uncles and cousins. My early teenage years were when the last few of my first cousins got married. I do sincerely hope they enjoyed their weddings but I honestly could not think of a more boring way to tie the knot. I think the typical Italian wedding was designed to suck every last drop of fun out of what should be a joyous occasion for everyone, especially the bride and groom. Starting with the church you get the high octane performance of an old man reading some older stories while you sit on an ass-numbing wooden bench. As a kid, the only thing I ever prayed for at a wedding was for the ceremony to be in English not Italian. "Dearly beloved we are gather here toda..." hearing this line triggers a reflex action where my eyes slowly close and little sheep appear in my mind jumping over a quaint little fence. After the mass the bridal party hop into some cool vintage cars tied with white ribbon and go off to have the exact same photo shoot that every other couple get. We all know which one is going to be printed in A1 black and white and framed in the dining room. You know the one, the couple are standing next to a tree, staring deeply into each others eyes, unnaturally grasping their waists. For the 3 hours that the shoot goes on for, everyone else has to find something to do before the reception starts. The smart ones go home. You know what's better than ~~wasting~~ spending half a day at a wedding? Spending the entire day at the wedding. 

It's actually a good thing there's 4 hours to waste after the Church. This allow you to recharge yourself so that you have enough energy to get you through the exhilarating reception. I think someone copy and pasted the blueprints to every Italian reception venue because they are all exactly same. The dining room will have an awful green or red carpet design with a sticky dance floor in the centre. The band will have perfected the the cliche list of English / Italian background music where the only songs people dance to are the Macarena, the Chicken Dance, and the Nut Bush. Oh and the food? We all the know the bread roll with shitty butter that's already awaiting you at the table will be the highlight of your meal.  

I've seen this wedding happen too many times, it's like a script has been written for the worlds most boring wedding. Maybe it's the parent's generation who force these unbelievably bland ceremonies. But you know what? I could deal with all this crap, but what I couldn't deal with is how the bride and groom end up "celebrating" their big day. I'd rather not have to spend the entire reception going around to the 200 people (most of whom I have not seen in 10+ years but my parents remained absolutely adamant that they come) greeting them and forcing awkward small talk. I'd rather not have Giuseppe and the Boys playing the hits of 1940's while interchangeable switching the vocals from English to Italian. I'd rather not have to eat the _worlds okayest lasagne_ followed by the _worlds dryest chicken_ prepared by a first year hospitality student from the closest university.  

I'd just rather not do it this way.

### Obligations

Ok that whole last section was basically me just poking sarcastic fun at the tradition events of a wedding. This is where I really feel my issues lie with weddings. I feel the pressure to have a wedding a certain way because of what is expected ruins it for me. I think a wedding should be an expression of both the bride and groom, not an expression of their parents.  

I fear the biggest fights will arise from the guest list. I have a small group of friends (definitely quality over quantity) and I see my close family as much as I can. To me, these are the people that I should be sharing my day with. They know me, they know us, they will hopefully be genuinely happy for us. I'd rather spend more money on the alcohol tab than invite some extended cousin that I see once every 5 years and their entire family too out of obligation.  

Is getting married in a hurry justifiable so that your grandparents can be there? I'm sure to some people it certainly is. My relationship with my grandparents has never been close and maybe one day I will regret feeling this way but rushing together a wedding for the sake of their attendance doesn't seem right. Plus, I doubt they will approve of not getting married in a church anyway.  

As I mentioned at the start of this post we've already been together 7 years. Everyone over the age of 55 has a mathematical formula for when to get married, apparently we are overdue. "I got married when I was 22..." congratu-fucking-lations! Times were different back then, getting married meant you could actually be together like an actual couple with the approval of both your parents and the Lord. Today (at least for us) the rules are much more relaxed and getting married seems like just putting the final label on our relationship. It also means a bunch of paperwork to change my partners last name, if she chooses to do so.  

It's also worth mentioning that the average age to get married has

### The Money

Call me cheap, that's fine. I've been called it before and it won't be the last time. But you would be incredibly naive to think that weddings are cheap. That's not to say they can't be expensive, I'm sure many people have gotten married on a small budget and have sincerely enjoyed their day. And I know that the parents of the bride and groom are supposed to front up most of the costs but that doesn't make it any better. My parents have already spent a shit tonne of money keeping me alive the past 25 years, I'd feel horribly guilty putting the financial burden on them. I dont mind spending lots of money on a wedding, but if I am going to do so, I better bloody well enjoy it.  

I know they say money can't buy happiness, but hiring a jumping castle for us and our guests would be a good way to start.

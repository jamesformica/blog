## ðŸŽµðŸŽµ Should I stay or should I go? ðŸŽµðŸŽµ
27<sup>th</sup> April 2017

I swear if it wasn't for [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) I would have never known that song even existed...

Long gone are the days where you graduate from high school, find a company, stick with them until retirement, climb the ranks one ladder rung at a time as people either retire or die. Or at least, that seems to be the sentiment shared by my fellow GenerationY-ians. Swapping jobs every three or so years seems almost expected and isn't as frowned upon on a resume anymore. Am I becoming stagnant?

In three days time my 25<sup>th</sup> birthday will arrive and apparently the quarter life crisis that comes along with it. (That does assume I will live to 100 years old which I highly doubt very much...) Instead of having a crisis, I've taken this opportunity to reevaluate my goals and look at where I want to be this time next year. In particular on this post I'll discuss changing jobs.  

### Reasons I should stay

- My current employment has been the most beneficial professional development that I've had. My seniors have been extremely patient with me in the early days and have valued my opinion on more recent projects. They have also been generous in acknowledging my skills and adjusting my salary accordingly. This has been without a doubt the best place of employment that I have had. And it seems to be the general consensus amongst the team. There is a high retention rate and I think that does say something about how good I have it compared to others out there.

- Friendships. I've made some incredible friends over the years who have helped get to where I am today. It feels like a small family sometimes and that's difficult to justify walking away from.  

- I don't think my current employment is done with me yet, nor am I done with it. I think there is still room for me to grow and I hope that is the case as I feel like I have more to contribute. There may not be any positions available to move up but there will certainly be opportunities to develop my skills further in different areas. They have already been happy to let me jump around and try different things to see where my efforts are best spent. I also feel like I need a couple more years under my belt before I can make the full jump over to the team lead side and I'm getting the chances to experience what it's like so it's the perfect scenario.

### Reasons I should go

- ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²! I had previously set goals of how much I would like to be earning by the time I hit this milestone and I've fallen a bit short. We all know that getting hired is the fastest way to make money. I know there are colleagues who have been somewhat recently hired who are earning much more than me. I also know that I have personally generated much more revenue for the business than they have. Money isn't everything, but it sure does help.  

- I've thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities I've been given to stand-in as a team lead. I can see this as a definite career path that I would like to investigate further. While it is very generous that I've been given these chances they aren't permanent, and I don't see a permanent position becoming available anytime soon. Am I too young to jump into one of these roles fulltime? Possibly, but that doesn't mean I can't look into it.

- Why not? I mean, I'm good at what I do and there's a whole world out there for me to apply my skill set. Seems to be that 3 years is the general marker for when to switch jobs and I'll be hitting that anniversary later this year.

### Final thoughts

I really enjoy where I am at the moment and have no real reason to move other than for fiscal gain. It seems the logical reason to stay, so why are so many people changing jobs so frequently? What part of the picture am I missing?

## The importance of getting away from development

3<sup>rd</sup> April 2017

It's easy to get consumed by the work we do. Some days I'll be writing code on the train in to work, then writing code throughout the work day, then writing code on the train back home, and you can probably guess what I do when I get home too. It's easy to get consumed and it's also easy to burn out. I've burnt out many times and I assume my fellow developers are no strangers to burning out and losing interest in projects too. I get so wrapped up in a project that I find it's all I can think about and that I become an alien to those around me. This weekend I was reminded about the importance of getting away from development and grounding yourself.  

"You guys wanna go camping next weekend?" The simple question my mate asked over a recent birthday lunch. Three of us guys ended up heading to a semi-local camping site in the wee hours of Saturday morning. Here are some of the highlights:

- Getting half way, then having to turn back for food an alcohol. We are not smart sometimes (it only gets worse). We assumed none of the local bottle shops would be open so we decided to drive one of the small towns on the way and stock up there. Turns out, they open even later so we had to take a 40 minute detour and head back in the direction we came to gather supplies.

- We bought a football from a locksmith/shoe repair shop. After we got food and alcohol we realised we didn't bring any form of sporting entertainment. Somehow my mates ended up in a locksmith shop who sold them a (AFL) football and even pumped it up for us. People in a small towns are lovely.

- We bought a frozen pizza and cooked it on the campfire. It was more of a joke than anything to see if it would actually work and it ended up being the best food we ate. By the time we arrived it had almost defrosted so we wrapped it in foil and threw it over some hot coals. Worked surprisingly well and I dare say we will be buying two next time.

- We only brought half a tent with us. Oh boy. Something always goes wrong and this was a pretty good one. My mate who supplied the tent only had the exterior weatherproofing cover and the pegs in the tent bag. The actual tent itself was nowhere to be seen. After we stopped laughing we attempted to construct some form of shelter just in case the weather turned bad on us (thankfully it didn't). We ended up sleeping in the car and I can tell you it was by no means comfortable. Nevertheless it will be something that we will always remember and I doubt my mate who provided the tent will live it down anytime soon.

The trip was still great fun and it was while I was sitting down at night staring into the fire that I realised it's been a long time since I got away from development. We get so passionate about what we do that we sometimes forget that there's a whole world out there that doesn't need the internet to access it. We didn't have our phones distracting us all day. It was just three mates, a campfire, a shitty makeshift tent, and some beers. I didn't know how much I needed that trip.

## The arduous journey to quit biting my nails

9<sup>th</sup> March 2017

I have anxiety. I believe most people do, although it's then a question of what brings on their anxiety and to what degree. My anxiety essentially revolves around disappointing people. That's a very vague statement but over the years I've come to accept it as the truth. I've never seen a professional about it so my self diagnosis could be all sorts of wrong. I claim to be no expert, just a victim of made up problems in my head that have more impact on my daily life than I would prefer. A side effect of my own little delusions as you have probably guessed is biting my nails. I hate it and I want to stop it.  

Disappointing people? Sounds like I want to be some hero like Captain Successful who always comes through and saves the day for an average joe with an average life problem in their mundane existence. Can I have a cape? Monday mornings are the worst for nail biting. When I sit down at my desk and look at the tasks I didn't complete the week earlier and the tasks I need to complete this week my anxiety kicks in a sits at the back of my mind asking "What if you don't complete your tasks. You'll let down your team and your managers and you will **[Pause: I am literally biting my nails on the train to work whilst writing this. Curse my subconscious and whatever it is worrying about now. Probably about disappointing my 2 readers of this blog... Hi guys!]** look like a failure. At work it's about letting down my managers, at home it's about letting down my family, in my relationship it's about not providing the life my partner deserves. All these things make me nervous and trigger the dumbest, most useless reflex action of biting my nails. It's so stupid, it makes no sense. My nails have never done anything bad to me, I've never had anything against them. So why oh why should they suffer for the dumb emotions my brain creates?  

Here's a fun chart that makes me feel better about myself by showing the percentage of humans that bite their nails at various stages of their life. At this rate I'll be in that 5% of Older Adults. I heard there's a club and they even have matching jackets! Looks like almost half of adolescents have something against their nails. I assume we can all guess what's on the mind of an early teenager üòâüòâüòâ clearly the housing crisis that baby boomers have generously left our generation!

I must apologise to you dear reader, for I have not been fully honest about my symptoms. Up until last year my painless suffering began and ended with nail biting. I'm not sure how it happened or why it happened but my logic bereft brain decided pulling out hair would be a wonderful addition to the grossness my hands were already being subjected to. What a grand idea brain, how do you do it? Fortunately I have been able to regain some cognitive control and have limited the hair harvesting areas to my index fingers and the tops of my hands. It's disgusting, it's abnormal, it's odd looking and it's simply ridiculous.  

Scientific American reported on a [study in July 2015](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nail-biting-may-arise-from-perfectionism/) that suggested that these nasty habits don't stem from anxiety but rather from perfectionism:

> Mounting evidence shows that people who compulsively bite their nails, pick their skin or pull their hair are often perfectionists, and their actions may help soothe boredom, irritation and dissatisfaction.

Well thats just great! If the study found that being a complete failure at life was the cause I would probably stop tomorrow but now my brain can justify it all by throwing around the fancy title of being a perfectionist.  Do I get bored? Sure. Do I get frustrated? Definitely! But I don't feel like my resting mood represents those emotions for majority of the day. Maybe you throw in a pinch of boredom, a sprinkle of frustration, a dash of stress and just a tiny spritz of anxiety and voil√† you have the perfect environment to support and nurture a chronic body-focused repetitive disorder! Call in the next ten minutes and we will throw in social retardation for FREE!!!  

### Quitting

Whether it be anxiety or a distorted form of perfectionism, I find that the hardest part about quitting is the fact that my habits are subconscious and by the time I realise I'm doing it, it's too late. The other hard part is there is no financial cost involved. Unlike smoking where you have to go out and buy cigarettes, your nails and hair just keep going back. I wish I had the optimism of my nails. Each time they grow back with the hope of not being bitten and for the better part of my adult life I have let them down each and every time. I have tried quitting many times. I've draw up calendars counting the days without biting, I've tried alternatives like chewing gum but nothing ever did quite work.  

I am currently trying to stop. I tried a different approach this time. Instead of trying to stop biting altogether, I focused on just one finger. The ring finger on my right hand. I do not know why I chose this finger, maybe it was the longest nail at the time. It's working. I think I've had this nail for about 3 weeks, and I'm actually getting to the point where I'll need to trim it soon. How exciting! I'm planning on moving onto its neighbour next; the middle finger on my right hand. I recently got laughed at when I compared quitting biting to quitting smoking with one of my friends (who is a smoker). They say every time you try to quit smoking you do a little better, I figure it's the same. Maybe this time I'll only succeed with one finger, but next time I might manage two. The point is to never stop trying to quit.  

Below is my hand at the current time of writing this. I neglected to mention, it doesn't help that I'm quite a hairy fella. I mean the missing hair is not subtle...

## Bored? R&D to the rescue!

1<sup>st</sup> March 2017

We've all been bored at work. Sometimes it's just for an hour or so, sometimes it can be days or weeks or months. I think back to the team I joined when my employment started 2 and a half years ago. It was a rewrite of an existing product and it was exciting. Requirements were thought up each day as we slowly built the foundation of what would become a product the whole business was excited for. Flash forward to today where the product has been released to alpha/beta customers. Priorities solely come from customer demands and all our fancy and cool ideas have been sidelined regardless of their value to the product. It got boring.  

Trialing mobile app development has been in talks for the last few months. We have some iOS apps but they are in ObjectiveC and no one wants to touch them. Xamarin has been gaining some traction lately and the word was that we would use it to build a native iOS and Android app. The project was suddenly green lighted. A meeting room no one used was fitted out with dev machines and named the Research and Development (R&D) room. The idea behind the room was that a small team (2 - 3 people) would spend 2 weeks isolated from the rest of the business with the intention of looking into a topic and coming out with some answers. This was **our** R&D project: 

> Can Xamarin be used to write native mobile apps that could be maintained in-house?

My colleague and friend Matt and I were chosen as the first R&D guinea pigs. Matt had used Xamarin before and is a very capable back-end developer. I brought front-end styling to the party so that if we did produce and app by the end of two weeks at least it would be pretty! We had both been looking for an opportunity to mix up our work and this would prove to be the project we were looking for.  

The room was away from the main open plan desk area. On each desk were gaming keyboards, mice, and monitors to excite inspiration and get the blood pumping? The room already had a space invaders wallpaper on one wall and another wall was coated in whiteboard paint. We were excited to move in. We soon worked our way up to 7 monitors between us and had the whiteboard wall covered in mockups, lists, and random doodles. Classic Rock Spotify playlists were chosen and played on a crappy little speaker and we set off to work.

### The effect on us

Neither Matt nor I realised just how much time we spent glued to our computers the first few days. Lunch breaks were practically non existent and going home almost felt like we were giving up for the day. We weren't even required to produce a functional app by the end of the 2 weeks but we both knew that was never going to happen. Not building an app would be failing in our eyes.  

One of the most interesting takeaways from the 2 weeks was our productivity. The amount we accomplished in those 2 weeks was significantly more than our usual output. Call it excitement, renewed motivation, isolation, loose requirements, or whatever, we can't deny that it worked. But as much as we worked we also goofed around. I brought in my Rocket League squishy ball from 2 blog posts ago. I remember spending about 25 minutes sitting in our chairs trying to kick the ball off the wall from me to Matt, then Matt trying to volley it back to me so I could catch it. I was in tears laughing at how awful we were. Maybe this combination of work and play is what kept our output so high for the majority of our time.

### The effect on others

Management were excited, thats obvious and it was good to see them actively trying to push forward our development skills. But what I really enjoyed was the enthusiasm displayed by the other developers. We would have daily walk-ins just to see what we were doing and hear about the app and our findings. We also _borrowed_ a seating chair from around the corner that no one had ever sat on. This also helped promote visitors and I swear that chair saw more bums on it in 2 weeks than it had the previous ~~2 years~~ 1 year and 2 months<sup>1</sup> we had been in the office. It seems that we weren't the only ones excited about the R&D room. I think the idea of having a small greenfield project with little requirements is what every developer dreams of. We thoroughly enjoyed our visitors and it added to our excitement. The most common remarks were:

- Oh you guys get to have music playing?
- It's so quiet back out at your old desks (apparently ~~we~~ I account for a lot of noise)
- So how's the super secret project going?
- Wow it smells in here

As awesome as it was to have the experience to be in the room, it was just as awesome to see the enthusiasm shown by the team about the app. I was constantly telling people to come up with an idea and get it into the queue of projects to go into the R&D room.

### Wrap up

It might have been hard to drag Matt and I out of the room when our 2 weeks were up, but I was thankful to have gotten the chance to experience the wonders of the R&D room and it's magical motivational powers. We decided to leave an R&D Hall of Fame list at the top of the whiteboard. The legacy of Matt and James lives on.
